## Self-hosting the Game

Currently, the project requires users to **self-host** both the game server and client.

### Requirements

- [`Rust`](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for the game's back-end
- [`npm`](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) for the game's front-end
- A Premium Spotify account to authorize application access to [Spotify Web APIs](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api)

### Building and Running the Game

Follow these steps to self-host the game

1. Clone the project repository:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/aome510/song-guessr.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies and build the front-end:
   ```shell
   npm install && npm run build
   ```
3. Serve the game's website:

   ```shell
   npm run preview -- --host
   ```

   ![npm preview](examples/vite-preview.png)

   The game's website will be accessible via the **network** URL.

   **NOTE**: This link can be shared with friends **connected to the same network** to access the game's website.

4. Build and run the server: open a new terminal tab and execute:

   ```shell
   cargo run --release
   ```

   When running the server for the first time, it will open a web page in your default browser, requesting permission to access your Spotify data (e.g., playlists). You should see a page similar to this:

   ![spotify auth](examples/spotify-auth.png)

   Click **Continue to the app** to authorize API access. If you are redirected to a page displaying **"Go back to your terminal ðŸ˜Š"**, the game's server has been successfully set up.

5. Visit the [Gameplay section](#gameplay) to learn how to create rooms and play the game with your friends.

### Gameplay

When you first visit the game's website, you will be prompted to create a user profile.

![create user](examples/create-user.png)

Once your profile is created, you will be directed to the homepage.

Click **Create a new room** to generate a game room. You will be redirected to a dedicated room page.

![room](examples/room.png)

Your friends can join the room using the provided URL (e.g., `http://10.253.229.92:4173/room/gjQXhM9M`). The **Users** section displays all active participants.

Quizzes are generated based on songs from a specific Spotify playlist. Use the search bar to find a playlist of your choice.

![search](examples/search.png)

You can adjust the number of questions and question types (e.g., song's name, album, artist, etc.). Click **New Game** to begin.

![game](examples/game.png)

Each round features a short snippet of a song. Depending on the question type, you must guess the correct song title, artist, or album.

Scores are based on accuracy and response time. Additionally, bonus points are awarded to the **fastest correct** answer.
